            Earth is our home planet. Scientists believe Earth and its moon formed around the same time as the rest of the solar system. 
            They think that was about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. Its diameter is about 8,000 miles. And Earth is the third-closest planet to the sun. Its average distance from the sun is about 93 million miles. 
            Only Mercury and Venus are closer.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
            an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
            of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
            the other scientific journals her work had
            appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
            The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
            since college, and the longer she spent in these
            four walls the more she felt she needed to be
            free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
            sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
            proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
            people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
            many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
            the secrets of the llama <abbr
            title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
            outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
            she had something better to do.</p>
